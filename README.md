# Social Network

A social network implementation in php

This is a social network I implemented in php. It includes most common social network features like profiles, likes, messages, photos, friends, settings, etc. I worked on this just improve my skills in php, and to confirm for myself that I can actually build a social network (although a really basic one :P). I learned a lot from this exercise.

I realised that PHP is not efficient enough for this use. There are better alternatives to this. So, I didn't go further adding more features to it or beautifying it.

Feel free to use the code for anything productive. If it works out well, don't forget to give a mention.
